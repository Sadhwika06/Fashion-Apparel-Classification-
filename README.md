#  Fashion Apparel Classification Using CNN.

##  Overview
This project focuses on **classifying fashion apparel images** (such as shirts, dresses, shoes, etc.) using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
The model is trained on a fashion dataset (like *Fashion MNIST* or *Myntra Dataset*) to automatically identify the type of clothing in an image.

## ✨ Key Features
- Image classification using CNN  
-  Data preprocessing and augmentation for better accuracy  
-  Model evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics  
-  Visualization of predictions (actual vs. predicted labels)  
-  Deployable for real-world apparel classification tasks

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is a **Fashion Apparel Dataset** from Kaggle (or a custom dataset).  
It contains labeled images of multiple apparel categories such as:
-  Shirts  
-  Dresses  
-  Shoes  
-  Watches  
-  Bags  
-  T-shirts, etc.

You can upload the dataset to your Google Drive and connect it in Colab.
