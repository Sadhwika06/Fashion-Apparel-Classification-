# Fashion Apparel Classification.


📘 Overview

This project focuses on classifying fashion apparel images (such as shirts, dresses, shoes, etc.) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The model is trained on a fashion dataset (inspired by the Fashion MNIST or Myntra dataset) to automatically identify the type of clothing in an image.

🎯 Project Objective

To build and train a deep learning model that can accurately classify fashion apparel into predefined categories by analyzing their visual patterns and features.

Key Features

Image classification using CNN

Data preprocessing and augmentation for better accuracy

Model evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

Visualization of predictions with actual vs. predicted labels

Deployable for real-world apparel classification tasks

Technologies Used

Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Google Colab

Dataset

The dataset used is a Fashion Apparel Dataset from Kaggle (or a custom dataset).
It contains labeled images of multiple apparel categories such as:

Shirts

Dresses

Shoes

Watches

Bags

T-shirts, etc.

You can upload the dataset to your Google Drive and link it in the Colab notebook.


Model Architecture

The CNN model includes the following layers:

Convolutional Layers – for feature extraction

MaxPooling Layers – for down-sampling

Dropout Layer – for regularization

Dense Layers – for final classification

Softmax Layer – for output prediction
